          <h2>  Expression</h2>
<p>
Sometimes<br>
Words aren't enough<br>
To express<br>
The feelings<br>
Beyond the stars<br>
The stories<br>
You told me<br>
Would stay<br>
Forever<br>
And ever<br>
In my heart<br>



The horrors<br>
I can't imagine<br>
But the happiness<br>
You shared<br>
Was real<br>
I hope we stay<br>
Like this<br>
For days to come<br>
And decades to go<br>


<br>
At last<br>
Congratulations<br>
For everything you've<br>
Accomplished so far<br>
Why is it so hard<br>
To end this story<br>
When I have so much to say<br>
About your glory!<br>


I can write a novel<br>
On your life<br>
Maybe two<br>
If you told me to write<br>
It's taking time<br>
But its worth<br>
Every second<br>
Every minute<br>
Of my life!</p>

        <h2>Desire</h2>
            <p>

I play with fire<br>
with a desire<br>
following instructions<br>
of my destruction<br>
a path I chose<br>
took me close<br>
to everything I want<br>
and nothing I truly desire<br><br>



Repercussions<br>
Cloud my mind<br>
What else is<br>
There to find<br>
I've achieved<br>
What I wanted<br>
But was it<br>
What I desired?</p>

            <h2>Mistake</h2>
                        <p>
                After you've done everything you wanted to do <br>
                What else is there to be explored and go through<br>
                If you had a choice will there be something <br>
                You would like to undo <br>
                <br>
    You think back and blink your eyes <br>
    You look for things you did wrong and those you did right <br>
     What exactly could you name a mistake?<br>
      What are the things that were at stake?<br>
       You sat on the swing in the night and began to contemplate
        <br>
     <br>
    Life is all about ups and downs <br>
    Like the swing on which you are trying to frown  <br>
    The more you push the higher you go <br>
    The zeal to achieve something great <br>
    Taking something that's beyond your fate <br>
    <br>
    You smile at the moon <br>
    If only you had known <br>
    You could've done something better <br>
    To change your future forever
    <br><br>
    But would you be here <br>
    Thinking without blinking <br>
    Sitting on a swing of hope <br>
    Why don't I think about the good things? <br>
    Why life is all about bling? <br>
    The nights get dark <br>
    The winds get cold <br>
    You remember the day <br>
    The hands that you hold <br>
    The people that were close <br>
    The gems that you lost <br>
    <br>
    But now you're all alone <br>
    What is that sound?<br>
    Is it the sound of nature<br>
    The sky the earth and every living thing <br>
    Are singing a song
    <br>
    <br>
    What is this? <br>
    Are you crying? <br>
    Was coming here a mistake<br>
    It was a risk you had to take <br>
    You smile and this time<br>
    It's not fake!<br>
    <br>
    Pushing the swing <br>
    You go up in the sky <br>
    You see the light <br>
    Everyone you had<br>
    Everything you lost <br>
    Was in sight <br>
    Nothing was even worth the fight<br>
    <br>
    Only if you had enjoyed <br>
    The moments of joy <br>
    Instead of sorrow and pain <br>
    From things you didn't gain <br>
    But you could never refrain <br>
    That was the beginning of your bane <br>
    <br>
    Why no one <br>
    Values what they have<br>
    And leave what they can't <br>
    Dreams are okay to keep <br>
    But only if they let you sleep <br>
    Don't be tensed <br>
    Give yourself some air to breathe<br>
    You don't have to stay on your feet <br>
    <br>
    You won't be where you are <br>
    If you did everything right<br>
    You may laugh at it now <br>
    But you know I am right<br>
    This is not the end <br>
    It's a new journey <br>
    Of finding who you are <br>
    And what you want to be

            <h2>Fear</h2>
                        <p>
                I was awake till late midnight <br>
                The wait was giving me a fright<br>
                It was 4 in the morning or you can say night<br>
                I was thinking about what I could've done in that fight
                <br><br>
    I know I can't change the past <br>
    I just want this happiness to last <br>
    I have kept my emotions buried <br>
    No one should see me worried<br>
    A big smile daunts my face <br>
    In the back, I get haunted in a gloomy chase <br>
    I run away from the thoughts that follow <br>
    Why do I feel so hollow?<br>
    <br>
    My eyes are getting wetter <br>
    Now that I am writing this letter<br>
    My heart feels better<br>
    Life is tough <br>
    The journey is rough<br>
    I promised myself <br>
    I won't feel bad <br>
    For whatever I get <br>
    Or whatever I had!<br>
    <br>
    I am optimistic<br>
    But it takes courage to act stoic<br>
    I wanted to write my heart out <br>
    I feel like I am floating on a cloud <br>
    Writing is a pleasure<br>
    Took away all the pressure <br>
    At last, I hope <br>
    This was an unnecessary trope<br>
    I will pass the test of time <br>
    I am starting to hear a beautiful chime <br>
    It's bright and so full of light<br>
    I'd love to hear it for the rest of my life        <br><br>
       </p>

            <h2>The Man from the Future</h2>
                        <p>
    What do we have here? <br>
    Another disappointment? <br>
    I think it's okay to say <br>
    You've accustomed yourself of this discontent <br><br>

    Let me take you to the future <br>
    How far you want to go?<br>
    Five ten how many years can you forego?<br>
    You want to know what is this blinding light?<br>
    It's your future, shining bright<br>
    <br>
    You don't believe me, you think it's fake?<br>
    I don't blame you, it's not your mistake<br>
    You think it's the end and want to leave <br>
    It is not there's a lot more to achieve<br>
    <br>
    Look at it now it's getting clear <br>
    Your life that's ahead of you , my dear <br>
    Don't you dare to cry it is not why we are here <br>
    It's not something painful that you have to bear <br>
    <br>
    Is that a smile on your face?<br>
    Wipe your tears, let it show some grace<br>
    Stop Right there <br>
    Take a breather<br>
    Let it go,be like a feather <br>
    Flying across mountains of rocks and deserts of sand <br>
    Rummaging through the never ending land<br>
    <br>
    Your time is over we have to go back <br>
    I hope you would get back on track<br>
    Let it all out, let it go <br>
    I know it hurts but look there you little hero<br>
    Yes that's you laughing at what you did <br>
    Looked so mature but acted like a kid <br>
    <br>
    Crying again?<br>
    You don't learn do you?<br>
    Is there something else you wanted to do?<br>
    Just what I expected, the answer is NO!<br>
    Don't do it, Don't look down <br>
    That's more like it <br>
    Smile a little more wide <br>
    In this never-ending heat <br>
    Show us your sparkling white teeth<br>
    Oh they are a little yellow <br>
    Sorry my little fellow <br>
    <br>
    Laughing are we now <br>
    Hahha make it loud <br>
    The whole world should listen to it <br>
    You have to make them reciprocate<br>
    <br>
    We are back where we started <br>
    It's time for me to get departed<br>
    See you again someday wherever you would be <br>
    After all, you are nothing but a younger me!<br>

        <h2>Sacrifice</h2>
        <p>
            We've searched the lands <br>
We've traveled the seas <be>
We've flown the skies <br>
To find the god <br>
To take his grace <br>
<br>
There's one place we forgot <br>
The most important of the lot <br>
It was there the whole time <br>
We were just blind to see it <br>
For what it was and what it meant<br>
<br>
They paid the price<br>
Of our success<br>
They laid the foundation<br>
Of our achievements <br>
They helped us <br>
Get through <br>
The darkest of times<br>
They made us smile <br>
Made us laugh<br>
<br>
I look back and think <br>
They were there <br>
The first time I blinked<br>
The first step I took<br>
The first word I said <br>
They made me who I am<br>
Without them, it's just a sham<br>
<br>
Still, I lied <br>
When I cried <br>
Couldn't tell them<br>
I was dying from the inside <br>
As the Gods they are <br>
They felt it too <br>
Putting our differences aside <br>
They made me smile <br>
I cried yet I smiled <br>
I got up and hugged them tight<br>
<br>
One day I'll make them proud <br>
But if I know them<br>
They'll just flout <br>
How selfless they are<br>
I can't put into words <br>
Everything they've done so far<br>
Is only for us<br>
<br>
I hope to say the least <br>
I want them to be happy <br>
Every time we meet <br>
All my time is <br>
Their property <br>
And they can use it <br>
The way they want it to be<br>
